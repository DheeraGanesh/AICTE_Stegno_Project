It focuses on developing a secure data hiding technique using steganography to hide sensitive information within digital images. 
The objective is to ensure the hidden data remains imperceptible to the human eye while maintaining the image quality and providing high security against detection and extraction attacks.
The solution should optimize data capacity, security, and resilience against common image processing operations like compression and noise.
